# A Flutter-101 Application

## Prerequisites

- A working version of Flutter configured on your machine (Version 1.2 or later).
- At least one setup for either android, iOS or Web.
- To run the web build, the Flutter-beta channel has to be the chosen channel for your flutter repository.

Run

> flutter doctor

..to verify that you are good to go. ðŸš€

### How to check out the beta channel

> flutter channel beta
> flutter upgrade

### Should I check out the beta?

Why not? It enables web which is nice. This application is also developed in the beta channel, 
so it should work fine.

## How we are going to work through this course

**First of all, fork this repository so you get access to it.**

It exists a few branches which is a step by step guide for how we are going to create the app!

- Step 1 - A blank app with some "backend" content. This is where we start and we'll create the first page with som mock data.
- Step 2 - Here we are going to create the rocket details page, still using mocked data. This will cover navigation between two pages.
- Step 3 - This is a small one. We are just going to add live data.
- Step 4 - A crew folder is added to the project, with a new screen. The task is to add a way to navigate to this page.
- Step 5 - We are going to implement the crew members pages. Hopefully we'll get through it all!
- Step 6 - The finished app.

The application is only meant to be used for educational purposes, and should probably not be put into production at any time.

Have fun!

An application highly inspired by #30daysofFlutter with some extensions.
