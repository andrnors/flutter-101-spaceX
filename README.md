# A Flutter-101 Application

## Prerequisites

- A working version of Flutter configured on your machine (Version 1.2x or later).
- At least one setup for either android, iOS or Web.
- To run the web build, the Flutter-beta channel has to be the chosen channel for your flutter repository.

Run

> flutter doctor

..to verify that you are good to go. ðŸš€

### How to check out the beta channel

> flutter channel beta
> flutter upgrade

### Should I check out the beta?

Why not? It enables web which is nice. This application is also developed in the beta channel, 
so it should work fine.

##### OPS
You might end up with Flutter 2.0, make sure that you are using version 1.2x. This application has not been tested with Flutter 2.0.
> flutter --version
## How we are going to work through this course

**First of all, fork this repository so you get access to it.**

It exists a few branches which is a step by step guide for how we are going to create the app!

- Step 1 - A blank app with some "backend" content. We will start of here and add some simple widgets.
- Step 2 - We are going to add a ListView, so we can list out all the rockets to a screen.
- Step 3 - Now we are going to add the RocketTile Widget, so our list of rocket looks pretty,
- Step 4 - Let's make the RocketTile Widget clickable, and create a RocketDetailsScreen. 

The application is only meant to be used for educational purposes, and should probably not be put into production at any time.

Have fun!

An application highly inspired by #30daysofFlutter with some extensions.
