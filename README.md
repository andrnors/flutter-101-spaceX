## How we are going to work through this course

**First of all, fork this repository so you get access to it.**

It exists a few branches which is a step by step guide for how we are going to create the app!

- Step 1 - A blank app with some "backend" content. We will start of here and add some simple widgets.
- Step 2 - We are going to add a ListView, so we can list out all the rockets to a screen.
- Step 3 - Now we are going to add the RocketTile Widget, so our list of rocket looks pretty,
- Step 4 - Let's make the RocketTile Widget clickable, and create a RocketDetailsScreen.

The application is only meant to be used for educational purposes, and should probably not be put into production at any time.

Have fun!

An application highly inspired by #30daysofFlutter with some extensions.
